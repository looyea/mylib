Yup, I do need a book management system. 
I don't like my Carlibre, it's suck
So What I need to do is to create something with my own ideas.

This one is focusing on books with:

- title
- subtitle
- author
- publisher
- ISBN
- status
- series
- category
- tag
- personal lib
- file name

and so on. 

this helps me to manage my ebooks with multiple views.
